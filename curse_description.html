<p>With version 1.0 AMTweaker leaves the realm of it's name. Support for several new mods and even some vanilla features was added, so AMT is no longer a hard dependency. Here's a short summary of what is supported. For a full overview of possibilities, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Belgabor/AMTweaker/wiki">Wiki</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apple, Milk &amp; Tea 2:</b> AMTweaker allows you to add or remove recipes for the food processor, jaw crusher, ice maker, tea maker, iron plate, clay pan and evaporator. You can add custom heat sources for the clay pan and iron plate and define charge items for electric charge and the ice maker.</p>
<p><b>EconomicalMilkTea:</b> You can add fuels for the diesel generator and add orders to the Order Box. Because of the complexity, the latter is not done via MineTweaker syntax, but via a JSON configuration file</p>
<p><b>MCEconomy2:</b> You can change, add or remove the default price for items/blocks. There is also limited support for some shops.</p>
<p><b>Sextiary Sector 2:</b> Support for recipes for all machines, fuel for the magic furnace and sandpit drops.</p>
<p><b>Caveworld 2:</b> Command to dump vein configuration in csv format for better readability.</p>
<p><b>Vanilla:</b> Change block harvest level and tool. Change a tools durability as well as it's tool type(s)/harvest level(s). This is not guaranteed to work for all blocks and items, especially modded ones. I also added a command that calculates within a range how many blocks are present. Useful for evaluating worldgen when creating a pack.</p>
